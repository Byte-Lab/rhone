 * This section contains definitions for messages and message types which are *
 * delivered from the BPF program running in the kernel, to the tasks running *
 * user-space which make scheduling decisions. There are two types of	      *
 * kernel -> user-space messages:					      *
 *									      *
 * 1. Per-cpu messages which are sent directly to RT commander task.	      *
 * 2. Management messages which are sent to a specific RT manager task.       *
 *									      *
 * The former types of messages are used for informing the scheduler about    *
 * tasks being enqueued, and a CPU going idle.				      *
 *									      *
 * The latter types of messages are used for informing the scheduler about    *
 * global state change, such as new tasks being added and removed from the    *
 * scheduler. These messages are often messages that need to be consumed in   *
 * FIFO order, and may require larger payloads such as passing a task's       *
 * CPU-mask. For this reason, this ringbuffer is substantially larger in      *
 * size than the per-cpu ringbuffers.					      *
